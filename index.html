            <p> This is where most of my information comes from </p>

        <p> Welcome, this website will have some information about Californian Weather Patterns using trusted outside sources and other information that I have compiled. This was just created by a student and do not trust all the information on this website as an official analysis. </p>

            <h2> Contrasts to Florida </h2>
         </div>
        <p> This "Marine Layer" isn't common in states like Florida, which have other weather phenomena, such as hurricanes. This is because, as the presentation stated, to have a thick, persistent marine layer, you need cool ocean currents, which is not the case in Florida, even though it is at a  similar latitude to California. Jet streams from the equator fuel Florida's waters and prominently contribute to the formation of Hurricanes, but not the marine layer.</p>

            <h2> Why doesn't California get Hurricanes? </h2>
        </div>
        <p> Piggybacking off the warm ocean currents in Florida and the cold ones in California. Many hurricanes form near California, especially around the coastal regions of Mexico. However, the ocean currents in the Pacific are different from the Atlantic, and the average sea surface temperature of these currents is not warm enough to sustain strong Hurricanes. Even in the peak Pacific Hurricane season from May to November, any Hurricanes that do manage to track upward toward California often deteriorate and at most bring showers and flooding to areas like San Diego. </p>
        <h3> Hurricane Hilary </h3>
        <p> A great example of a Hurricane deteriorating before reaching California is Major Hurricane Hilary. Major Hurricane Hilary formed as a Tropical Storm on August 16th, 2023, and quickly strengthened into a Category 4 Hurricane. Now, as this storm approached Mexico, it weakened significantly, making landfall over Baja California on August 20th, where it began to impact California. By the time it reached California, however, it became too weak to sustain its winds, especially over land. Even before landfall in Baja California, weak ocean waters significantly hindered its growth, resulting in the exponential decline of the storm as its circulation was disrupted by the mountainous terrain of California.   </p>
